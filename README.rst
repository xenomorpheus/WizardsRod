Suggestion is to use virtualenv to manage project environment and dependencies

    python3 -m venv  .venv                             # Create environment
    . .venv/bin/activate                               # Activate (start using) the enviroment
    pip3 install -r requirements_development_TODO.txt  # Install packages
    cd Brain
    make
